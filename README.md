# SocketBasedChatServerJava
This Github repository contains the source code for a Java socket programming chat server app that allows multiple clients to connect and chat with each other in real-time. The app uses threads to handle multiple client connections simultaneously, ensuring that the server can handle a large number of clients without affecting performance.

The app is built using Java socket programming, which allows for low-level communication between applications over a network. The server-side code includes a main server thread that listens for incoming client connections and spawns a new thread for each client that connects. Each client thread handles the communication between the server and a specific client, allowing for real-time messaging between clients.
